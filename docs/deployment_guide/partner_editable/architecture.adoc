.Quick Start architecture for {partner-product-short-name} on AWS
image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/architecture_diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, this Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.
* A virtual private network (VPC) configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.
* In the public subnets:
** Linux bastion hosts in an Auto Scaling group managing inbound Secure Shell (SSH) access to Darktrace vSensor instances in the private subnets.*
* In the private subnets:
** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound internet access to Darktrace vSensor instances.
** An Auto Scaling group of Darktrace vSensor probes hosted on Amazon EC2 instances. 
* VPC traffic mirroring to send mirrored traffic to a Network Load Balancer.
* A Network Load Balancer to distribute monitored VPC traffic to Darktrace vSensor instances.
* An Amazon S3 bucket to store packets captured by Darktrace vSensor.
* Amazon CloudWatch to provide:
** An alarm to invoke dynamic scaling of the Darktrace vSensor Auto Scaling group. 
** Logs to collect metrics from Darktrace vSensor EC2 instances.
