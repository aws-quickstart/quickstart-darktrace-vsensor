==== Register a push token

Register a new push token to enable connection between vSensor probes and an existing on-premises Darktrace appliance. All of the vSensor instances in this deployment share the same push token.

NOTE: Darktrace cloud instances are already configured to allow push token access.
//TODO: Is the above correctly worded? In other words, this section is only for registration of a push token on an on-premises appliance?
. Log into the Darktrace console.
. On the main menu, choose *Admin > System Config*.
. In the *Push Probe Tokens* section, enter a label for the vSensor deployment.
. Choose *Add*. A token is generated in the form of `[label:string]`. 
. Record the token, as it only displays once. You must enter the token in the *Appliance push token* link:#_parameter_reference[parameter] field during Quick Start deployment.

If your Darktrace appliance is behind a firewall, you must grant access to the appliance to the IP addresses of your NAT gateways after deployment. For more information, see link:#post-deployment-steps[Post deployment steps], later in this guide.
